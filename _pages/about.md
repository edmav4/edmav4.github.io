I am a postdoctoral researcher at Rice ECE, working with Prof. Ashok Veeraraghavan and Prof. Ashu Sabharwal. I received the Ph.D., M. Sc. and B. Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Universidad Industrial de Santander, Colombia, in 2023, 2018 and 2016, respectively. My main research interests are computational imaging, compressive sensing, high dimensional signal processing, optimization, integrated
sensing and communications and machine learning.
